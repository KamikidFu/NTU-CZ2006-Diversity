This is a group project for CZ2006 - Software Engineering in [NTU](http://www.ntu.edu.sg/Pages/home.aspx).

WeVo is an application to support local community connection and welfare. WeVo stands for `We` and `Voluntneer` so this is a platform for both charity or organisation and people who want to work some volunteering jobs.
